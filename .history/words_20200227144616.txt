2016年即将过去，新年的钟声即将敲响。在这辞旧迎新的美好时刻，我向全国各族人民，向香港特别行政区
同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞，向台湾同胞和海外侨胞，向世界各国各地区的朋友们，致以新年的祝福！
The year of 2016 is coming to an end, and the
bell of the New Year is going to ring.
At this happy moment of ringing out the old year
and ringing in the new, I would like to extend my
New Year wishes to people from all ethnic groups
across China, to our compatriots from Hong Kong
and Macao Special Administrative Regions, to our
compatriots from Taiwan region and overseas, and
to friends from all countries and regions across
the world.
2016年，对中国人民来说，是非凡的一年，也是难忘的一年，“十三五”实现了开门红。我们积极践行新发展
理念，加快全面建成小康社会进程，推动我国经济增长继续走在世界前列。我们积极推进全面深化改革，供给
侧结构性改革迈出重要步伐，国防和军队改革取得重大突破，各领域具有四梁八柱性质的改革主体框架已经基
本确立。我们积极推进全面依法治国，深化司法体制改革，全力促进司法公正、维护社会公平正义。我们积极
推进全面从严治党，坚定不移“打虎拍蝇”，继续纯净政治生态，党风、政风、社会风气继续好转。
For the Chinese people, the year of 2016 is not only outstanding but also unforgettable. We made
a good start of the 13th 5-year National
Development Period which spans from 2016 to 2020.
We actively carried out the new development
concept, accelerated the process of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, maintained our economic growth ranking the first in the world. We vigorously pushed forward the comprehensive deepening of reform, made important steps in terms of supply-side structural reform, achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the reform of national defense and the military, and the main frame of reform in all fields with "multiple pillars" has been established. We actively promoted the building of a law-based governance of the country, deepened the reform on the judicial system, enhanced judicial justice in an all-round way, and maintained social fairness and justice. We vigorously pushed forward the exercise of our Party's strict governance in every respect, unswervingly cracked down on both "tigers" and "flies", in a bid to purify our political ecosystem, and continue to improve our Party and our government's working style, as well as our social conduct.
