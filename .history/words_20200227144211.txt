2016年即将过去，新年的钟声即将敲响。在这辞旧迎新的美好时刻，我向全国各族人民，向香港特别行政区
同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞，向台湾同胞和海外侨胞，向世界各国各地区的朋友们，致以新年的祝福！
The year of 2016 is coming to an end, and the
bell of the New Year is going to ring.
At this happy moment of ringing out the old year
and ringing in the new, I would like to extend my New Year wishes to people from all ethnic groups across China, to our compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, to our compatriots from Taiwan region and overseas, and to friends from all countries and regions across the world.
